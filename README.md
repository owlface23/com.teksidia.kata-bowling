This is a collection of my templates/solutions for [Uncle Bob's Bowling Game kata](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata). It is useful to demonstrate the principles of TDD. The original Powerpoint that documents the TDD steps is included in the project root.

Includes:
* C# Template (using NUnit)
* Javascript solution (using Mocha/Chai)
